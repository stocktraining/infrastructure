Infrastructure
==============

This is the infrastructure / vagrant portion for the Stock Training team.

Assumptions
===========

I assume that you have Vagrant [1.3.5](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.3.5).

Further, you should also have [VirtualBox 4.3.2](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

The Box
=======

We are using Ubuntu 13.04 as our base box, currently.

As of right now, it's just a base Ubuntu box.  I'll work on adding packages via Puppet next.
